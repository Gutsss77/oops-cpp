# oops-c++
In C++, "oops" typically refers to "Object-Oriented Programming" (OOP), 
which is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. 
It includes concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.

These file will provide a Great overview of OOPs in C++ : (Follow the sequence or jump where you would like to)
    1. Class and Object (Base.cpp)
    2. Encapsulation (Encapsulation.cpp)
    3. Inheritance (Inheritance.cpp)
    4. Friends for class concept (Friend.cpp)
    5. This Keyword (ThisKeyword.cpp)
    6. How Virtual Keyword works (Vitual1.cpp and Virtual2.cpp)
    7. Polymorphism (Polymorphism.cpp)
    8. Abstraction (Abstraction.cpp)
